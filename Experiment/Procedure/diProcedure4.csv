Your doctor is describing some interactions that may occur between medications that you're taking.</p> <p> A <i> medication interaction</i> occurs when one drug affects the activity of another drug when both are used together.</p>  <p>Please advance to see more instructions.</p>",,,,,,,,off

<p>For each interaction that you study, you will see two medications and the outcome that would occur if they were to be taken together (e.g., ""dry mouth""). Each outcome will only occur once -- that is, only one pair of medications will result in dry mouth.  </p> <p>Please advance to see more instructions.</p>",,,,,,,,off
