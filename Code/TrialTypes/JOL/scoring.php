     * Q: Why are we using $data instead of setting values directly into $_SESSION['Trials']?
     * A: $data holds all scoring information and once scoring is complete $data is merged into $_SESSION['Trials'][$currentPos]['Response']
     *    Using $data as a middle man is needed becasue if scoring is happening on a `Post # Trial Type` then when merging $data back into $currentTrial['Respnonse']
     *    the program will automatically prepend each stored key with 'post#_' (e.g., $data['RT'] would be merged as $data['post#_RT] iF scoring is happening for a 'Post 1 Trial Type')
